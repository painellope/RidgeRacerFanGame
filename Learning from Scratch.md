# Learning from Scratch

Having a total of maybe 5 hours of consistent struggle in unity, and maybe 14 seconds of fear trying to wrap my head around C# or coding in general, this is going to take a while. But the only way to begin is to start so here we are.

## Goals

* Create scripts to tie car drift behaviour to track direction and orientation, like the handling model of Ridge Racer games.
* Model 3D assets for the track and cars
* Create an appealing graphic style and UI interface
